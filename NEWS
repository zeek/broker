Broker 2.3.0 (in progress)
==========================

  * Broker now requires at least CMake version 3.15.0.

  * Internally, much of Broker's transport layer has been
    rearchitected for better maintainability and future functionality
    extensions. While this remains mostly invisible to users, the
    changes had to break backwards compability with older Broker
    versions.

  * Broker now offers access to its publish/subscribe layer via
    WebSocket in order to make its data model accessible to third
    parties without requiring access to Broker itself.

    A Broker endpoint can be configured to act as a WebSocket server
    by either setting the environment variable
    ``BROKER_WEB_SOCKET_PORT``; by setting ``broker.web-socket.port``
    on the command line or in the configuration file; or
    programmatically by calling ``endpoint::web_socket_listen()``. See
    ``docs/web-socket.rst`` for more information.

    While still experimental for now, the WebSocket support (incl. the
    data model) aims to remain stable over time and will become the
    recommended way for external applications to talk to Broker
    applications (and hence Zeek).

  * The Python bindings now provide additional support for immutable
    (hashable) types. The ``SafeSubscriber`` class and the
    corresponding ``Endpoint.make_safe_subscriber()`` method ensure
    that immutable Python types get used, and that the returned values
    remain read-only. For sets the ``frozenset`` type achieves this;
    for mapping types it's ``types.MappingProxyType``. The API now
    also supports the latter two types as inputs.

  * All CAF dependencies have been removed from public headers, and we
    now build the bundled CAF version as a static, private utility.
    Consumers of Broker no longer need to locate CAF headers and we do
    not install any CAF content alongside Broker anymore, i.e., Broker
    becomes fully standalone.

    Where possible, Broker uses recent C++ additions like
    ``std::variant`` to replace CAF types. For types that have no
    equivalent, Broker deploys fully opaque handle types. For example,
    ``broker::worker`` internally wraps a ``caf::actor`` handle.

    All components in Broker that require access to CAF were grouped
    into the new namespace ``broker::internal``. We omit all internal
    headers from an installation, since they would be worthless
    without the matching CAF headers anyways. This also gives us a
    clean separation between API artifacts users may interact with and
    API parts that are reserved for internal use.

Broker 2.2.0
============

- The Python bindings now provide a SafeSubscriber variant of Subscriber as well
  as a new Endpoint.make_safe_subscriber() method. Both avoid potential problems
  when deserializing values that accommodate the Broker data model but not
  Python's. Specifically, Broker allows complex types inside others (e.g., a set
  of tables), but Python does not support unhashable types for indexing, which'd
  be required in this scenario. SafeSubscriber employs immutable (hashable)
  types when translating to Python objects and returns objects that are
  read-only.

  If you haven't encountered problems with the Subscriber class, you don't need
  to change existing code. Broker 3.0 will make this new behavior the default
  and deprecate the new APIs. In the meantime you can replace make_subscriber()
  with make_safe_subscriber() to be on the safe side.

Broker 2.1.0
============

- Broker 2.1.0 now depends on CAF 0.18.4

- The RocksDB data store backend was removed as building with it was previously
  broken/unusable.

- Added the ability to output metrics to Prometheus. This can be enabled by
  setting the BROKER_METRICS_PORT environment variable. Currently the output
  includes a number of CAF-related metrics and per-process CPU and Memory
  metrics.

Broker 2.0.0
============

- Broker 2.0.0 now depends on CAF 0.18.0 with a wire format targeting
  compatibility with Zeek 4.0.x.

- CMake 3.5+ is now required to compiler Broker.

- Support for the optional Python Bindings now requires at least Python 3.5

- For proper resource management/cleanup, the Python API now requires
  using Endpoint, Subscriber, StatusSubscriber, and Store objects within a
  `with` statement or alternatively doing an explicit call to the
  `reset()` method of subscriber/store objects before the associated
  Endpoint's `shutdown()` method.

Broker 1.4.0
============

- Adds a new ``broker::store_event`` API that can be used to observe
  data store modifications.

- Adds support for Windows platform.

- RocksDB support is now opt-in instead of automatically detected and used
  at configuration-time.  Use the ``--enable-rocksdb`` and
  ``--with-rocksdb=`` flags to opt-in.

Broker 1.3.0
============

- A C++17-capable compiler and CMake 3.0+ are now required to compile Broker

- Broker 1.3.0 depends on CAF 0.17.4.  Broker 1.2.x had depended on CAF 0.16.x,
  whose wire format changed and is now incompatible with CAF 0.17.x.
  Zeek 3.0.x shipped with Broker 1.2.x, which means Broker 1.3.x cannot be
  used to communicate with Zeek 3.0.x, only 3.1.x (and possibly later, check
  for updated release notes for compatibility clarifications).

Broker 1.2.0
============

This release contains breaking API changes (for C++ code, not Python)
in order to increase messaging efficiency via reduction of data
copying.  Specifically:

- ``broker::subscriber::get()`` now returns a different, copy-on-write
  type called ``broker::data_message`` rather than an
  ``std::pair<topic, data>``.  For example this old code::

      auto sub = ep.make_subscriber({"/topic/test"});
      auto msg = sub.get();
      auto& topic = msg.first;
      auto& data = msg.second

  can be changed to::

      auto sub = ep.make_subscriber({"/topic/test"});
      auto msg = sub.get();
      auto& topic = broker::get_topic(msg);
      auto& data = broker::get_data(msg);

- ``broker::endpoint::publish(vector)`` now takes a vector of the new
  ``broker::data_message`` type, not ``std::pair<topic, data>``

- Generally, all type aliases within classes, like
  ``value_type = std::pair<topic, data>``, have been changed to use the
  new ``broker::data_message`` type.

- The semantics of message forwarding have changed slightly: the
  first sender of the message is now the one that applies the initial
  TTL value.  Previously, the first receiver would be the one to
  apply the initial TTL.
